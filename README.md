# Java Academy (Junior - Middle)

Version: **1.12**

<i>JAcademy</i> is the project that teaches to program in the java language and to think as an engineer.
Each topic has small explanation of a problem or an idea and the solution, you can use it as you wish and as you want.

As a start point, let's address to:

[Programming Principles](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-practice/ "Programming Principles"),
[Software Architecture Cheat Sheet](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-practice/ "Software Architecture Cheat Sheet");

## [Practice](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-practice/ "The practice chapter")

This is the practice module where the solution should be written. There the following tasks:
